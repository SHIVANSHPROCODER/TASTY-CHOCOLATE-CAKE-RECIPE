Choose your pan size: Preheat the oven and prep your cake pans. You will want to check the recipe notes below for more information on what type of baking pan you want to use or for “bite-sized” portions try making cupcakes!
Combine dry ingredients: Whisk the mixture to incorporate all of the ingredients (and whisking means no sifting required).
Add wet ingredients: Beat with a hand mixer until the batter is well mixed!
Add boiling water: Slowly add boiling water to the batter – it will seem thin at this point, but that’s okay! It’s going to bake into a light, fluffy, spongy chocolate cake! Mmmmm….
